            <p>I'm Rebecca Karungi, a solutions developer for the Web.</p>

            <p>
              I create web services and applications. Innovative design and
              compelling architecture are my go-to moves with all my projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have been in the development space for nearly three years now
              and have close to one year of working experience. Iâ€™m always
              curious about learning new skills, tools, and concepts. In
              addition to working on various solo full-stack projects, I have
              worked with creative teams, which involves daily stand-ups and
              communications, source control, and project management.

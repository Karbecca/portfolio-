            I&apos;m Gisa Chris, a solutions developer for the Web.
          </p>

          <p>
            I create web services and applications. Innovative design and compelling architecture are my go-to moves with all my projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have been in the development space for nearly three years now and have close to one year of working experience. Iâ€™m always curious about learning new skills, tools, and concepts.
            In addition to working on various solo full-stack projects, I have worked with creative teams, which involves daily stand-ups and communications, source control, and project management.
